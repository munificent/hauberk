Still thinking about how I want classes and subclasses to work. I don't have it
figured out yet, but I did have one thought worth noting.

Currently, a class is simply a set of proficiencies. Each class effectively
disallows some skills or makes some skills more expensive to learn. This is a
really simple model and easy to implement. It also allows me to define a long
list of classes that each mix and match skills in different ways. So I create
classes that work like "dual classes" or any arbitrary combination. That's nice.

But it also means that classes are less uniquely interesting. Let's say you
pick "sorcerer". Unless sorceror has proficiency in a skill that literally
every other class has 0.0 profiency in, then there's nothing truly new about
playing that class versus playing others. It has the same skills and powers
that other classes have just a different subset.

The current mechanic feels a bit like Taco Bell where it's easy to make a menu
with a bunch of different items that are all just combinations of the same few
ingredients. It's nice for generating a lot of variety, but there is an
inherent same-y-ness to it.

## Unique class experience

There needs to be some overlap in capabilities between classes. There will
definitely be multiple classes that can cast *some* spells, or use a bow, or
repair a basic piece of armor.

But if there's going to be a decently long list of classes and subclasses
(whether the player chooses it at creation time or later in the game), I'd like
each one to have some unique feel to it, some experience you can only get from
that class.

## Unshared skills

I don't think this means necessarily means the core mechanic is broken. It
could be that the right solution is to define more skills where all but one
class really does have zero proficiency in it. That in turn will make the skill
entirely unique to that class.

For example, we could define some high level school-specific spells that only
mages subclasses that specialize in a specific school can ever learn.
