In the previous note, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how classes and
subclasses could work with experience as a spendable currency. I think the
answer for now is that I don't know enough about priest and rogue mechanics and
skills to sort that out.

That's OK, though. Currently, the *only* thing that hero experience level does
(aside from sending the signal to the player about progress) is determine how
race effects stat values.

I can eliminate level and make experience a currency which you spend to raise
stats. That won't interact with classses or any other part of the game. So
probably the first step is to do that and see how it feels.
