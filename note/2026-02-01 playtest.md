Being able to immediately buy a torch for 16 gold and get a good light radius
feels too cheap/easy.

Stray cats do quite a lot of damage.

Food clock feels like food lasts a very long time. Nice for not being annoying
but kind of feels like food is pointless.

The tuned dungeons are defintely better: darker rooms, less stuff on the ground,
more empty space. Feels more like you're exploring a dungeon.

Feels like it takes a while before reaching first experience spend.

The first thing a warrior can afford is mastery, but it feels kind of strange
to level up in a weapon that's basically a random choice early on.

The masteries are broken where level 1 doesn't actually improve anything. Just
gives you... +0% damage.

The way heft improves melee damage is very unclear on the inspector.

Dungeon levels feel a little large. Some of the rooms are a little large too.
There should be a big room every now and then, but feels like they should be
rarer.

Stairs don't stand out visually very well.

Staves are hard to use early on because they take up both hands and don't leave
anything free for a light source.

If I want players to improve gear by saving up for stuff and buying it, then
gold could stand to be a little more common.

Imps and sprites that have ranged attacks are interesting early enemies. They
make rocks actually somewhat useful.
