OK, so I was working on the plan from the previous doc, but then started having
second thoughts. If I make the weapon special attacks things that all classes
can do all the time, then warriors really start to feel like a subset of
magic-using classes where they just have strictly fewer actions they can
perform.

I think there should be *some* magic-using classes that can also access the
weapon special attacks. But if you're primarily a mage-like class, your melee
abilities should be pretty limited.

## Skills unlock powers

This suggests a different design. As you level up a skill like axe mastery, at
some level it unlocks the axe sweep attack. So maybe skills aren't themselves
actions you can directly perform, but they provide access to those at certain
levels.

Let's call those performable actions "powers". Then the idea is that axe sweep,
club bash, spear stab, etc. are all powers that you can gain by leveling up the
corresponding mastery skill to some point. Probably not a super high level, but
enough that primarily magic-using classes aren't likely to reach it very early
in the game but warriors are.

## Archery

What about ranged weapons? Is shooting a bow a power you have to gain too? In
real life, it is a pretty skillful activity. I'm not opposed to saying you have
to put a level into archery before you can use a bow at all.

## Multiple weapon powers

This mechanism opens the door to potentially having multiple powers for a given
weapon type at different levels. I'm not sure what they would be, but if I come
up with some, it would give warriors more things they can do later in the game
beyond just making numbers go up.

## Spells

If skill levels unlock powers, that suggests that we build spells on the same
mechanic. There is a skill for each spell school. At certain levels, the skill
unlocks the next spell in that school.
