Members of the rogue class live on the edge. They have little in the way of morals, but carry a large number of tricks and techniques to help them make the morst of any situation. They are willing to sneak around, backstab, or kill to reach their objective. They know a little magic, a little about different types of weapons, and quite a wide range of skills. They are also particularly good at carrying around a large collection of possessions.

## Play style

Rogue players want a high-tension, dangerous game. They want to constantly be
surprised, and have a variety of tricks for getting out of any dangerous
situation. They want to spend time choosing the right skills to aid in survival,
but not with the up-front planning that mages require. They also want to spend a
lot of time gathering the proper gear to bring with them into the dungeon.

## Class powers

**OLD NOTES:**

*Instead of skills, how about class powers always being related to gear, kind of
like FF Tactics? So lock-picking gear lets a rogue improve his lock-picking
skills, certain daggers improve backstabbing, etc.? Would make it more different
from priest.*

Rogues have a number of different skills. Each skill has an associated level.
Every time a rogue gains an experience level, they can choose two skills to
increase as well. All of the skills have a chance of failure based on the
rogue's agility. The skills are as follows:

* **Backstabbing:** Rogues are particularly effective at attacking unaware monsters. When hitting a monster that has not noticed them with a melee weapon, the base damage is multiplied by 1 + their skill level in backstabbing.

* **Assassination:** Much like backstabbing, rogues are excellent shots when
  firing upon stationary monsters. Before firing, a rogue can choose to spend a
  number of turns aiming at a monster that is not moving. Every turn spent doing
  this successfully increases the damage multiplier that will be applied to the
  shot when that monster is fired upon. A rogue can do this for a number of
  turns up to their level in the skill. If the rogue is struck or the monster
  moves while the rogue is aiming, the effect is cancelled. If a round of aiming
  fails, it does not cancel previous aims.

* **Pickpocket:** A rogue can attempt to steal the treasure being carried by a
  monster by pick-pocketing the monster. The odds of this succeeding depend on
  whether or not the monster is awake, its level, and the rogue's level of skill
  and agility. If successful, the rogue acquires whatever the monster would have
  dropped, as well as a fraction of the experience given by slaying the monster.

* **Stealth:** The greater a rogue's stealth, the less likely nearby monsters
  will notice him and wake up. Monsters will still be woken up by other nearby
  awake monsters, but a stealthy rogue can often move at will in the dungeon
  without being noticed.

* **Lock-picking and disarming:**

* **Hide in shadows:** If a rogue removes any light sources, and stands still in
  the dark, he may blend into the shadows and be overlooked by monsters that are
  chasing him. When this happens, the monster will generally wander around
  randomly, and possibly fall back asleep. Some monsters who don't navigate by
  sight or are particularly keen will not be fooled as easily.

* **Perception:** Always on the lookout for trouble, rogues have keen senses and
  often notice even that which is hidden. This includes traps, and rogues have a
  chance of perceiving any undiscovered trap within eyesight. The chance of
  success with this skill starts at zero, but increases by 5% every level.

* **Poison:** Using a few simple components, a rogue can concoct poisons which
  can then be placed on melee weapons or arrows, adding additional poison damage
  to the weapon. Eventually gain the ability to create poisons that sleep,
  charm, slow, or confuse monsters when struck.

* **Tools:** How about making a rogue's forte using tools and items in the
  dungeon that have emergent effects? Things like bombs, tripwires, etc. So a
  thief lays complicated traps and sets them off when monsters approach. Or uses
  items to snare other items from the dungeon.

* **See in the dark:** Years of hiding in shadows and prowling at night give the
  rogue an enhanced ability to see in minimal light. Increases view distance
  beyond the limits of the light source. Combines nicely with stealth and hiding
  in shadows, since walking around with a light tends to make one less stealthy.
